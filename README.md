# gee_samples

This is a repository to store use-case examples of earth engine code.

## How to use 

## How to contribute

Will follow a GitHub-flow collab framework - will provide instructions here

Follow these instructions for further guidance: https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/

### Contributing Larger More Complex Examples

If you GEE workflows are embedded into larger projects (i.e R projects, websites/dashboards) with more connected components (i.e external data sets) it does not necessarily make sense to store the entire work flow here. Therefore, we recommend following the above steps, but at step 5: rather than adding files or folders just edit this README document to include a link to your github repository. Please make sure your linked repo has a descriptive readme.
